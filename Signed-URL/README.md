## Singed URL

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple demonstration of signed URLs in Laravel. Signed URLs are a feature of Laravel that allow you to generate temporary URLs that include a signature to verify that the URL has not been tampered with. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to limit access to a particular resource or action to a specific user or group of users, but you don't want to require them to log in or otherwise authenticate themselves.

In this repository, we have included a basic Laravel application that demonstrates how to use signed URLs. The application includes a simple newsletter subscription form that allows users to unsubscribe newsletter.

By using signed URLs, we can ensure that only the user who was initially subscribed to the newsletter can access their subscription information. If someone were to try to modify the subscription ID in the URL, the signature would no longer be valid and the request would be rejected. This helps to prevent malicious actors from accessing or modifying sensitive information.

Overall, this repository provides a useful example of how to use signed URLs in Laravel to secure your applications and protect your users' data.
